## About The Project
It is a prototype for a VR project I am working on. I am utilizing an Event-Driven Architecture based on scriptable objects. By doing this, I am able to achieve better modularity, which makes it easier to maintain and add new features.

Since it is a prototype, not everything is perfect. Here is a list of things I would change:
* Add a state machine: Currently, the project is not yet large enough to feel uncomfortable working without a state machine. However, due to the list of future updates, it is a good time to add a state machine to make it easier to control states.
* Add a centralized component to handle all the inputs from controllers, completely separating the internal logic from the inputs.
* Add an editor tool to generate blueprintables and buildables automatically based on a single prefab.
